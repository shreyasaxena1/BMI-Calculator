# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

This project consist on creating an App that calculates BMI ( Body Mass Index ) & then report its status. </br>

In this project I tried to simplify all the process using the most simple formula & dividing the BMI state into just 3 categories...

BMI Formulat : bmi= weight (kg) / ( height^2 (m))

BMI Categories:

Low : bmi <= 18.5
Normal : 18.5 < bmi < 25
High : bmi >= 25
